# Landing Page Project

The starter project has some HTML, CSS, and javascript.
 I convert it from a static to a dynamic version, now you can scroll smoothly to sections when clicking on the navigation list, when you make a new section will add a new navigation list automatically,and when you scroll to a section will be added to it a new class "active"
